      Main research topics have included digital watermarking, JPEG/JPEG2000 standard, data compression, 3D graphics, and wavelet transform. Recent researches focus on CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) based image processing and computer vision, Camera sensor ISP(Image Signal Process), and various ADAS such as e-mirr! or system, moving object detection on dynamic scene, traffic signal recognition, camera based BSD(Blind Spot Detection), visibility enhancement of HUD(Head-Up Display) and etc.. Non-linear control theory is also interested research area.
